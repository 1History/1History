1History will automatically detect history of different browsers by default, users can use =show= subcommand to check what it can find.

Users can also use =-f= option to set other history files to backup, the file has the following naming convention:
| Browser | History Filename |
|---------+------------------|
| Chrome  | History          |
| Firefox | places.sqlite    |
| Safari  | History.db       |

** Serve
After backup browser history into 1History, the next step is to visualize those data.

* FAQ
- =Error code 5: The database file is locked= :: This error happens if your browser is opened during backup, as SQLite allow only one open connection.

  Close the browser is one solution, or you can copy history file to other directory other than default location.
